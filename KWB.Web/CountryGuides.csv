<strong>KWB’s Highlights:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The Jewish community of the Cayman Islands started to emerge in the 1970’s as local Jews began to come together to study, worship, and support each other in the continuity of their Jewish heritage.</li>
 	<li>The Cayman Islands is a British Overseas territory in the Western Caribbean Sea. It is an ideal business jurisdiction; sophisticated, stable, and strategically located only one hour flight from Miami and 3.5 hours from New York City.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Shabbat:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>You can enjoy an elegant Shabbat dinner with the Cayman Jewish Community. Meet Jews from all over the world, dine on traditional Shabbat delicacies, with flavours of the Caribbean, complemented by the words of Torah and good company.</li>

 	<li>The most popular and developed area of Grand Cayman is Seven Mile Beach. It is widely known for its beauty, recently receiving the honour of “The Caribbean’s Best Beach”.</li>
 	<li>There are hundreds of options for lodgings along Seven Mile Beach. The Beit Hillel Chabad House is located at the southern end of Seven Mile Beach, right off West Bay Rd and a short walking distance from the many condos and hotels in the area.</li>

 	<li>There are so many different things to see in Kyoto. We hope to expand this section soon. Can you help?</li>
</ul>
<strong>ARASHIYAMA</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Do not miss Arashiyama. It's a day trip that cannot be missed right outside Kyoto. Choose a day with good weather. You get there by subway or bus. Very easy.</li>
 	<li><b>Okochi-Sanso Vill</b><strong>a:</strong> One of the top sights in Kyoto. It rivals any of the city’s imperial properties, and you don’t need reservations to enter.</li>
 	<li><strong>Bamboo forest and the bridge</strong>: You can access it directly from the main street of Arashiyama, a little to the north of the entrance to <a href=""http://www.insidekyoto.com/tenryu-ji-temple-arashiyama"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Tenryu-ji Temple</a>, but it’s best paired with a visit to that temple (exit the north gate, take a left and you’ll be in the grove in no time). There’s just one main path through the grove, which leads slowly uphill. Once you get to the top of the hill, the entrance to the sublime <a href=""http://www.insidekyoto.com/okochi-sanso-villa-arashiyama"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Okochi-Sanso Villa</a> is right in front of you (go in, you won’t regret it).</li>
 	<li><b>Togetsukyo Bridge (15 minutes): </b>Cross the Togetsukyo Bridge and spend a few minutes viewing the bridge. Some of the best views are from downstream of the bridge.</li>
 	<li><b>Bamboo Groves (30 minutes): </b>From Tenryuji walk to Arashiyama Station and rent a bicycle, then head into the bamboo groves behind Tenryuji Temple. Turn right as you get to the entrance of <a href=""http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3912.html#okochi"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Okochi Sanso</a> and continue towards <a href=""http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3912.html#jojakkoji"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Jojakkoji</a>.</li>

<strong>KWB's Highlights:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Disney allows you to bring food, drinks snacks without any hassle.</li>
 	<li>The only rule is no loose ice.</li>
 	<li>Some Disney restaurants offer ready to go (without reservation meals), while others require advanced reservation.</li>

 	<li>We recommend skipping this option and bring your own sandwiches instead. But some travelers might like the convenience.</li>

<strong>MUST READ: Tips for enjoying your visit to the park more.</strong>

 	<li>Kid ticket price is from 3-9 years old.</li>
