<strong>More details:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The capital city of New Delhi is considered the most convenient starting point for backpackers in India. The first stop in town is the central market – the “Main Bazaar”, located in the midst of old narrow streets in a crowded, noisy and filthy area.</li>
 	<li>In the heart of the market, in a modest and pleasant building, ever since 5755 (1995) sits the oldest Chabad House in India.</li>
 	<li>The Chabad House has been run in recent years with admirable devotion by Rabbi Shmulik and Mira Sharf.</li>
 	<li>Under extremely hard conditions they welcome hundreds of new backpackers who have just set foot on Indian soil every day, and they do so warmly and with a smile.</li>
 	<li>The backpackers who have a hard time getting used to the crowded city, find a quiet Jewish home in the Chabad House. Thus the Chabad House in New Delhi functions as a gateway to all the other Chabad Houses in India.</li>
 	<li>The Chabad House provides the visitors and the hotels in town with Kosher food. It has an information centre for the backpackers on all the relevant issues and it also supports Jewish inmates in Indian prisons.</li>
 	<li>As a Chabad House located in the capital city, it coordinates all the assistance in urgent medical cases, the procedures involved when Jews pass away in India and the rescue of backpackers in hard mental states, as well as those captured by pagan sects. The Chabad House in New Delhi also serves as the link between all the Chabad Houses in India in order to promote joint goals.</li>

<strong>Travel Tips:</strong>

For a city with such a small permanent Jewish community, we are blessed with a very fine kosher restaurant. The kosher restaurant located at the Chabad House is the only Kosher restaurant in Bangkok. Managed by Yossi Goldberg, this restaurant boasts a menu containing the full range of kosher food – vegetarian, fish, chicken and meat. It is from this restaurant that all kosher food in Bangkok is catered.

For a small additional fee, the restaurant will deliver food to your hotel.Keeping with Chabad of Thailand's policy of providing kosher food in Thailand at the same price as equivalent non-kosher food, meals at the restaurant are inexpensive. This enables travellers of all budgets to eat kosher food and take advantage of the Chabad House's catering services.

<p class=""font_8""><strong>Jewish Center of Iceland</strong></p>
<p class=""font_8"">Chabad Jewish Center of Iceland is a home where everyone is welcome - regardless of affiliation, level of knowledge or observance.</p>
<p class=""font_8"">They strive to create a warm, welcoming environment to explore and experience our heritage in a non-judgmental and inviting atmosphere.</p>
<p class=""font_8"">This Chabad was founded on the principle that, while Jews may embrace many levels of observance in their personal lives, there should be a place for all Jews - no labels and no affiliations - to develop a sense of community, to enhance the experience of being Jewish, to learn, and enjoy Judaism.</p>
<p class=""font_8""><strong>Their mission:</strong></p>
<p class=""font_8"">To strengthen the Iceland community by promoting Jewish pride, education and celebration.</p>
<p class=""font_8"">To provide for the spiritual &amp; material needs of all Jews in the community - regardless of their background, affiliation or financial means, and to provide insight and explanation on Judaism’s history and universal values to our friends beyond the Jewish community who would like to learn more.</p>
<p class=""font_8"">To establish a warm and traditional community centre where everyone is made to feel welcome and comfortable.</p>",,,,https://scontent-lga3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/87066445_2738669176456247_4661862639582838784_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=8bfeb9&_nc_ohc=H_otsGWq5hwAX8Z703J&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.xx&oh=46ebf3fc1907134d5551aa756f76713e&oe=61BFF793  https://scontent-lga3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.6435-9/47306765_2326020497721119_147483700861337600_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=730e14&_nc_ohc=IPisDktMBdcAX_q3DUj&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-2.xx&oh=2aa3156f9916ea344e8d79dd631fd65b&oe=61C0181E,,,,Chabad ,,Europe,Island,,,,Chabad Iceland,https://www.jewishiceland.com/ourprogrmas,moderate,64.1465820,-21.9426354,"Reykjavík, Iceland",,,,,,,15/2/2018,13/10/2020,,

<strong>KWB's Highlights:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>This centre is for all your Jewish needs in Monaco and Monte Carlo.</li>
 	<li>The Association Culturelle Israelite (ACI), the official representative body of the Jewish community in the Principality of Monaco, a city-state located on the French Riviera, was founded in 1948.</li>
 	<li>Prior to World War II, approximately 300 Jews lived in Monaco. During the war, the government issued false papers to protect its Jewish citizens but deported Jewish refugees trying to find a safe haven in Monaco.</li>
 	<li><span style=""color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit;"">In 2015, Prince Albert II of Monaco formally apologised for his country’s role in the Holocaust and dedicated a monument to these deported Jews at Monaco’s cemetery.</span></li>
 	<li>Today, around 1,000 Jews, the vast majority retirees, live Monte Carlo. The ACI has a synagogue in a converted private residence. In addition, there is a Chabad centre. Monaco’s cemetery has a small Jewish section.</li>
